# Asymptotic Notation 
Mathematical representation of Time & Space Complexity of an algorithm.

Asymptotic Notation was the 2nd term that was adopted, First was experimental theory

### Experimental Study
	- run a program and then calculate the time
	- fixed input size

### Limitations
	- can be only done on a limited set of input
	- to compare, same set of hardware and software should be used


## Why use Asymptotic Analysis?
1. Platform Independent - unaffected by different hardware
2. Generalization - generalized throughout the systems
3. Scalability
4. Theoretical Guarantee 

### Steps in Asymptotic Analysis

1. Define the Input Size(n)
2. Determine the Basic Operation
3. Express the Algorithm's Performance
4. Simplify Using Dominant Terms

## Types
1. Omega
2. Theta
3. BigO

#### Where is Used?

	-Algo Design
	-Comparison of Algo

#### Advantages:
	1. Abstract and universal
	2. Predicts Behaviour for Large Inputs
	3. Mathematical Precision
	4. Facilitates Comparison

#### Disadvantages:
	1. Ignores Constants and Practical Factors
	2. Not Always Reflective of Real Performance
	3. Assumes Arbitrarily Large Inputs
	4. Doesn't Capture Data-Specific Behaviour
