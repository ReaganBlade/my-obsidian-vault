An easy guide to set-up a Next Js Project
### **Step 1: Install Node.js**

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. You can check by running:

```sh
node -v
```

If not installed, download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

---

### **Step 2: Create a New Next.js Project**

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

Or using **yarn**:

```sh
yarn create next-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with your project name.

---

### **Step 3: Navigate to the Project Folder**

```sh
cd my-next-app
```

---

### **Step 4: Start the Development Server**

Run the project locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or using **yarn**:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at **[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)**.

---

### **Step 5: Open the Project in a Code Editor**

If you're using **VS Code**, run:

```sh
code .
```

Or **Windsurf**, run:

```
windsurf .
```

---

### **Step 6: Modify Your First Page**

Edit `pages/index.js` or `app/page.js` (if using App Router) and add some changes to test.

---

### **Step 7: Build and Export (Optional for Deployment)**

For production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:

```sh
npm run start
```
